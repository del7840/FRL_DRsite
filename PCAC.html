          <p class="line1">I see the role of AC in FRL as a platform only for vintage racing with beautifull older cars and amazing historic tracks which dont even exist anymore or the historic versions of famous tracks that most of the modern drivers dont even know that existed. 
            There is something exceptional about driving those older cars, with manual gears, no tc, no abs and almost no downforce. If you add to that the diversity of the the cars, where even within one car class the difference between the way the cars handle is amazing. You kind of have an open card, where you can drive the same car on the same track in two completly different driving styles and still get the same time result at the end. So you can say the driving is more demanding but at the same time the satisfaction reward is uncomparable.
            Once you try it, its hard to go back to ACC and the GT3's.
            I could be blabering about this for a long time:) 
            The main point is that, I have plans and ideas for some fantastic championships and events on AC (wednesdays) but I guess we will have wait and see how the first race will go and what will the particants have to say about the level of fun, and what they would expect in the future.
